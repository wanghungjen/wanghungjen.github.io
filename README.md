# [My Personal Website](https://wanghungjen.github.io)

## Motivation

In a digital world filled with flashy, dynamic websites, I found myself drawn to something simpler — something clean, stylish, and straight to the point. When a friend introduced me to this [template](https://github.com/wemake-services/jekyll-theme-hackcss), it instantly clicked.

I was captivated by its minimalistic design and nostalgic ASCII-style aesthetic. As someone passionate about software, I appreciated how the theme balances simplicity with personality. The built-in widgets are practical and make it easy to present myself effectively without unnecessary clutter.

Inspired by this, I immediately rolled up my sleeves and started building my personal website on top of this template.

## Development

Development went quite smoothly — one of the perks of working with a simpler, lightweight template. Coming from previous software engineering experience with React, the HTML-based syntax felt familiar and approachable.

The real learning curve came with serving the site. This was my first time using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so it took a bit of digging to understand its structure, get comfortable with some Ruby, and figure out how to properly host the pages.

That said, once everything was up and running, Jekyll turned out to be an efficient and reliable tool for serving static sites. No complaints after that!

## Conclusion

After a few weeks of designing and coding, I'm happy to say I've created my first online portfolio. It's incredibly rewarding to have a small personal corner of the web that showcases my work and achievements.

I'm excited to continue building on it — adding new projects, sharing my experiences, and watching it grow alongside my journey in software and beyond.
